Gilded Rose Specification
=========================

Welcome to the Gilder Rose thrift shop! We buy and sell only the finest goods.

Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell-in date. We have a software program that updates our inventory. The developer who built the system has left to open a bar in Ibiza, so the maintenance work has been passed on to you.

Here is an introduction to our system:

	- Items have a SellIn value which is the number of days we have left to sell the item.
	- Items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is.
	- At the end of each day, our system lowers both values for each item.

Pretty simple, right? Well, there are also a few additional rules:

	- Once the SellIn date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast.
	- "Old cheese" actually increases in Quality as it gets older.
	- The Quality of an item is never negative.
	- The Quality of an item is never more than 50, except for "Collector" items.
	- "Collector" items have no SellIn and never decrease in Quality, even if their initial Quality is above 50.
	- "Concert tickets", like cheese, increase in Quality as their SellIn value approaches. Their Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less, and by 3 when there are 5 days or less. However, their Quality drops to 0 after the concert.

We also started selling fancy fashionable items. This requires an update to our system:

	- "Fashionable" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Feel free to make any changes to the UpdateQuality method and to add new code, as long as everything still works correctly.
